# Operating Systems Class Assignments
All of my class assignments for Operating Systems course at Oregon State University. Programs files and code provided upon request as this is an on going course as instructed by the University.

# Program 1 - Matrices
This assignment asks to write bash shell scripts to compute matrix operations. The purpose is to get familiar with the Unix shell, shell programming, Unix utilities, standard input, output, and error, pipelines, process ids, exit values, and signals (at a basic level).

# Program 2 - Adventure
This assignment asks you to write a simple game akin to old text adventure games like Adventure:
  [Colossal Cave Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure)
Write two programs that will introduce you to programming in C on UNIX based systems, and will get
you familiar with reading and writing files.

# Program 3 - SmallSH
In this assignment you will write your own shell in C, similar to bash. No other languages, including C++, are allowed, though you may use any version of C you like, such as C99. The shell will run command line instructions and return the results similar to other shells you have used, but without many of their fancier features.

# Program 4 - One-Time Pads (OTP)
In this assignment, you will be creating five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a onetime pad-like system. I believe that you will find the topic quite fascinating: one of your challenges will be to pull yourself away from the stories of real-world espionage and tradecraft that have used the techniques you will be implementing.  \n

These programs serve as a capstone to what you have been learning in this course, and will combine the
multi-processing code you have been learning with socket-based inter-process communication. Your
programs will also accessible from the command line using standard UNIX features like input/output
redirection, and job control. Finally, you will write a short compilation script.

# Program Python
In this assignment, you will be given ZERO instruction in HOW to accomplish it! The actual requirements are very simple to satisfy. This is a test of how well you can research the topic and satisfy the conditions of this Assignment on your own. For this assignment, you will create a script in the Python language.All execution, compiling, and testing of this script should ONLY be done in the bash prompt on our class server!
